Fonty Python comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
see the COPYING file.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; see the COPYING file 
for details.

NB: Remove the old version BEFORE you install FP.
==============
You can find the path by:
locate fontypythonmodules

If that does not work, then you must update your locate database:
As root run: locate -u
Go make coffee.Then run the locate command above again.

This will give you a directory something like:
/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/fontypythonmodules

Use your root account to remove that folder:
sudo rm -fr /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/fontypythonmodules

(Be *very* careful what you type!)
You should be good to go now.

How to install
==============
Please see the end of this file if your install fails, there are
certain files that FP relies upon.

I assume you have extracted the "tarball" already.
Change to the directory it creates.

As the root user enter this command:
python setup.py install

If you are on Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Xubuntu/Debian etc:
sudo python setup.py install

This will create a program called 'fontypython'

Alternative installation
========================
Move the entire extracted folder to a folder that
is in your PATH, like ~/bin
Make a link to the fontypython script like this: (for e.g.)
tar -s ~/bin/fontypython-x.x.x/fontypython .
Make it executable:
chmod u+x fontypython

Now you should be good to go.
If it does not work, try closing your console and
starting it again.

Running the program
===================
To get started:
fontypython -h

For more info:
fontypython -e

Please read the help ( -h or Help menu in app ).

Troubleshooting the installation
================================
Fonty Python depends on several other libraries:
( These are minimum version numbers )
1. python2.4 to python2.6 (Not python3)
2. python-dev (odd one this. See notes below)
3. python-imaging
4. python-wxgtk2.6 or greater.

Items 1 and 3 are usually pre-installed on Gnu\Linux distros.
Item 2 is a new twist. I am not sure why it's required for FP
(yes - I don't know everything :)) but some users have had
problems and installing python2.4-dev fixed them.
(replace 2.4 with the actual version of python you are using.)
On *buntu:
sudo apt-get install python2.4-dev

If you cannot install item 2 - try the alternative 
installation instructions above.

Item 4 may be installed, or it may be in your distro's
main repository.To install item 4, try the following:
On *buntu/Debian:
apt-cache search python-wxgtk
Find the latest version in the list, then:
sudo apt-get install python-wxgtkX.Y
(replacing X.Y with the results of your search)

On distro X:
*Please send me your experiences and I'll fill this in*

After this has installed, try to run fontypython again.

If you still do not come right, then I advise you
to go to the following web sites for help directly
from the horse's mouth:

LOCALIZATION TIPS
=================
Make sure your LANG variable is set properly.
To run under a locale, do something like this:
LANG=en_ZA.utf8
./fontypython

You can find your locales by:
locale -a

If localization is not working it could be that there is no 
translation for your language yet, it can also be a 
problem with missing packages in your distro.

This is what I installed on my system (Kubuntu 7.10 as of 
December 2007) while I was developing:
 
language-support-fr
language-support-en
language-pack-gnome-fr (*)
(*) This one is VERY important, it has many stock translations for GTK. Without it
you likely not see buttons and widgets in the right language.

Substitute your language code as you please.

TRANSLATION TIPS
================
If you want to help translate, please contact us via the 
fontypython list: fontypython@googlegroups.com

I have included the pot files that I have. Look at fontypythonmodules/pofiles/README
(Translation stuff is messy. Headers are all wrong and versions all over the place.)
